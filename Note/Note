Delete the old database file so that onCreate() is run again. This is often preferred at development time where you have control over the installed versions
and data loss is not an issue. Some ways to to delete the database file:
Uninstall the application. Use the application manager or adb uninstall your.package.name from shell.
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe
adb uninstall com.yuccaworld.yuccaslim

To check if date is today, use Android utils library
DateUtils.isToday(long timeInMilliseconds)
This utils class also offers human readable strings for relative times. For example,
DateUtils.getRelativeTimeSpanString(long timeInMilliseconds) -> "42 minutes ago"

This is a known problem with the Firebase CLI 3.17.0 through at least 3.17.3, but only on Windows. You can fix this on your machine by editing firebase.json at the root of your project and replacing $RESOURCE_DIR with %RESOURCE_DIR% in the npm commands you see there. The former is the unix syntax way to use an environment variable, whereas the latter is the Windows command shell syntax. Since you're using Windows, you need to use the Windows syntax.
